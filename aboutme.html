            Hello! My name is Austin but I prefer to go by Alec. I enjoy <br>
            playing video games, watching shows and movies, and playing <br>
            with my cat. I am currently a junior studying UX design. I <br>
            also have knowledge in programming.
        </p>
        <p id="paragraphhobby">
            I enjoy playing video games quite a lot. Recently, I've <br>
            been getting into the Fallout franchise and have played <br>
            Fallout: New Vegas two times. I also enjoy shows and one <br>
            of my favorite shows recently is Severance.
